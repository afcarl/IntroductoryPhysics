# Description  
The more I learn about the scientific community, the more I learn about the
issues of sexism and racism affecting women and minorities wanting to do
research. There is definitely a stigma against women and women of color
wanting to do research at a professional level. Countless are the cases, of
female scientists that have to choose between having a family and their
professional careers, and smaller is the number of women of color that have a
leadership position in the labs where they do research. For this reason, it is
important to shed the light on inspiring women who are making major
contributions to their fields because they are role models that future
scientists can look up to. I found a scientist who is making groundbreaking
discoveries in the field of lasers. Her name is Hadiyah Green and she is
developing laser technologies to kill cancer cells. She earned her PhD in
Physics from the University of Alabama Birmingham. After her closest relatives
were diagnosed with cancer, she decided to use her background to develop
lasers that selectively target cancer cells through the use of nanoparticles.
She has tested her treatment on mice and has obtained promising results. In
the future, she hopes to advance her research to make it useful for humans.
