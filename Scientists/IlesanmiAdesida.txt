# Description

Ilesanmi Adesida is a physicist of Nigerian descent who is currently
the provost at Nazarbayev University in Kazakhstan (“Ilesanmi
Adesida”). Adesida is an expert in the processing of semiconductors
and other materials at the nanometer-scale level and in high- speed
field-effect transistors, which are found in cell phones (“Ilesanmi
Adesida”). While he was a professor at the University of Illinois at
Urbana-Champaign, he and his students worked on these transistors in
cell phones and other electronic devices by developing devices in the
key materials such as indium phosphide, silicon carbide, and gallium
nitride used in high- performance wireless applications (“Ilesanmi
Adesida”, “Who are the Black Physicists”). His other activities center
on studying dislocations in gallium nitride using photoelectrochemical
etching and investigating high speed field-effect transistors in
various chemical structures (“Who are the Black Physicists”).
