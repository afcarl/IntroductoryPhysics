# Description
The main contribution of Isamu Akasaki is in the semiconductor field. He, along with Hiroshi Amano and Shuji Nakamura invented efficient blue light-emitting diodes, and won the 2014 Noble Prize in Physics. He worked on GaN to make high-brightness blue LED light. As a result, people are able to have bright white LED light as an energy-saving light source.
