# Description

Amalie Emmy Noether was a German mathematician and physicist known for her
landmark contributions to abstract algebra and theoretical physics. One of her
most remarkable discoveries in physics was Noether's theorem. The theorem
states that every differentiable symmetry of the action of a physical system
has a corresponding conservation law. In 1915, Noether was helping two other
scientists, David Hilbert and Felix Klein, to understand Albert Einstein's
general relativity theory when she proved Noether's first theorem. Upon
receiving her work, Einstein wrote to Hilbert: "Yesterday I received from Miss
Noether a very interesting paper... I'm impressed that such things can be
understood in such a general way. The old guard at GÃ¶ttingen should take some
lessons from Miss Noether! She seems to know her stuff."

Noether's theorem has become a fundamental tool of modern theoretical physics
because of the insight it gives into conservation laws and also being
practical calculation tool. For example, suppose that a new physical
phenomenon is discovered. Noether's theorem provides a test for theoretical
models of the phenomenon: if the theory has a continuous symmetry, then
Noether's theorem guarantees that the theory has a conserved quantity, and for
the theory to be correct, this conservation must be observable in experiments.
