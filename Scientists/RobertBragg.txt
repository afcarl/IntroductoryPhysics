# Description  
Robert Bragg was a African American born in Jacksonville , Florida in 1919 .
He has made major contributions in the areas of materials characterization
using x-ray diffraction and small angle x-ray scattering, and their use as a
tool in studying heat-activated processes in materials. He developed methods
of quantitative x-ray diffractions of compounds; e.g., Ca(OH)2 in hydrous
silicates. Robert Bragg originated the now-standard practice of using the data
as self-calibrating in the quantitative determination of preferred orientation
in polycrystalline aggregates. His work provides clear guidance in the
analysis of the diffraction patterns of materials of high transparency to
x-rays, e.g. Be, B, and C. His novel studies of the coarsening of the
microstructure of glassy carbon using small angle x-ray scattering have
provided the accepted value for the activation energy for a-direction vacancy
migration in graphite.His most important work is the recent demonstration that
all apparently unordered carbon materials are mixtures of metastable carbon
compounds, and his first principles derivation of the equations governing the
phase transformations at high temperatures as these materials are converted to
graphite.
