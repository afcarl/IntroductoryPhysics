# Description  
Ruby Payne-Scott was an Australian born physicist and radio astronomer. She
began work as a physicist with the cancer treatment center at the University
of Sydney where she focused on radiation therapy as a form of cancer
treatment. She later completed her master's thesis on wavelength distributions
of radiation. Ruby worked briefly as a teacher before receiving a job in the
radiophysics division of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research
Organization where she worked on radar technology for the army. Her most
notable contribution, however, lay in her interest in extraterrestrial radio
signals. She demonstrated, with the help of two colleagues, that radio
brightness across the sky could be treated as a two-dimensional sum of an
infinite series of simple waveforms and showed that it could be computed using
the Fourier transform. Ruby's work served as a mathematical foundation for
radio astronomy. In addition to being a brilliant scientist, she was an avid
supporter of women's rights believing in equal employment and pay for women.
