# Description  
Shin'ichirō Tomonaga was born on March 31, 1906 in Tokyo, Japan. He is a
Japanese scientist who won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1965 for developing
basic principles of quantum electrodynamics. He was a professor of Physics at
the Tokyo University of Education. From 1937 to 1939, he was in Germany to
study nuclear physics and the quantum field theory. In 1940, he developed the
intermediate coupling theory in order to clarify the structure of the meson
cloud around the nucleon. During WWII, he solved the motion of electrons in
the magnetron and also developed a unified theory of systems consisting of
wave guides and cavity resonators. Dr. Tomonaga was the President of the Tokyo
University of Education from 1956 to 1962. He has actively campaigned against
the spread of nuclear weapons and for peaceful use of nuclear energy.
