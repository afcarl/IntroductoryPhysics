# Description  
Sir Chandrasekhara Venkata Raman was the first Indian Physicist to win the
Novel prize for his work in light scattering. He was born on November 7th,
1988 in Tamil Nadu. His father was a professor of physics and mathematics and
his mother came from a family of scholars. In 1921, when he was returning to
India from London, on the voyage, he became fascinated with the blue color of
Mediterranean sea. He had some physics apparatus on him - a prism, a miniature
spectroscope and a diffraction grating - which he used to prove that the sea
was scattering sunlight by water molecule, which refutes Lord Rayleigh's
explanation that the color of the sea is a reflection of the color of the sky.
But Rayleigh argued that the blue color of the sky was caused by scattering of
sunlight by the air molecules. From Raman's discovery, he was obsessed with
the idea of light scattering. Analyzing the effect of scattering light by
water was not easy, so Raman made visual observations of how scattered lights
of different color passed through liquid. This visual observation is now
called the Raman scattering and is the result of the Raman effect - the change
in the wavelength of light that occurs when a light beam is deflected by
molecules. Raman effect was an important discovery because after its
discovery, physicists used this technique to study the vibration and rotation
of molecules. By the late 1930s, the Raman effect was a principal method of
chemical analysis because Raman spectroscopy could be easily used to solid,
liquid, gas and aqueous solutions.
