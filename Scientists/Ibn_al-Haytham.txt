# Description  
Ibn al-Haytham (c.965 - c.1040 AD), aka Alhazen, was a physicist as well as a
mathematician and astronomer during the Islamic Golden Age. Alhazen is most
known for his contributions to optics and the scientific method. Going against
the emission theory of Euclid and Ptolemy and the intromission theory of
Aristotle, Ibn al-Haytham theorized that we see objects because the eyes
receive the rays of light that reflect off an object (Wikipedia). His most
famous work, Kitāb al-manāẓir, described this phenomenon and included details
about reflection and refraction. Ibn al-Haytham was keen on using
experimentation and mathematical reasoning to support his theories (Lorch).
Alhazen also had an understanding that to prove a hypothesis, one must perform
experiments of have numerical evidence. Through this practice, he showed an
understanding of the scientific method many centuries before it was
established. In addition to sight and the scientific method, Alhazen
investigated the rainbow, moonlight, celestial physics, motion of the body,
and more (Wikipedia).
