#Description

Sylvester Gates is an American theoretical physicists for the Ford Foundation
Professor at Brown University. Gates has received many accolades for his work
including being a member of the National Academy of Sciences and receiving the
National Medal of Science from President Obama. His work relates to
supersymmetry, supergravity, and superstring theory, especially relating to
the Adinkra Symbol to gain a better understand and graphically represent
supersymmetric algebras. As a kid Gates gained an interest in the physics from
books that his father brought home that inside was Schroedinger's equation.
From that moment Gates became shocked by the mathematical representation of
the world around him, ranging from the simple movement of a ball down a plane
to a physics of the cosmos.
