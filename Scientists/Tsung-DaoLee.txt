# Description  
Tsung-Dao Lee is a Chinese-American physicist, known for his work on parity
violation, the Lee Model, particle physics, relativistic heavy ion physics,
nontopological solitons and soliton stars. He was a recipient of the 1957
Nobel Prize in Physics at the age of 30. Lee conducted the majority of his
life's research at Columbia University, where his first work was on a solvable
model of quantum field theory known as the Lee Model. Later, he worked on the
puzzle of K meson decay, through which he studied parity non-conservation in
weak interactions. This work led to his winning the Nobel Prize in Physics. He
was also very active in statistical mechanics, astrophysics, and a number of
other disciplines.
