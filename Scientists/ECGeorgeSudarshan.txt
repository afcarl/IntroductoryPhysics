# Description  
E. C. George Sudarshan is a theoretical physicist born in Pallam, Kerala. He
has made significant contributions such as proposing the theory of V-A
WeakForce which is central to radioactive decay and nuclear fission.
Controversially, he was not awarded a Nobel Prize for his work on quantum
optics (Sudharshan-Glauber representation), while Glauber received recognition
for it in 2005.
