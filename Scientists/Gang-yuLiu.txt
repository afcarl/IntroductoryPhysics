# Description  
Gang-yu Liu is a chemist and professor at the UC Davis. She graduated from
Beijing University and received her M.A. and Ph.D. degree from Princeton
University by 1992. Her research is focused on development of nanotechnology
and potential applications to bioanalytical chemistry ("Gang-yu Liu", 2017).
To investigate the cancer cell signaling and allergy, she has used high
resolution images taken by AFM (Atomic Force Microscopy) and published papers
about her research on nanostructures of ligands and receptors.Through her
research using AFM, the method for nanografting for determining the
orientation and packing of biomolecules on surfaces has been developed
significantly. Also, her research on nanotechnology and bioanalytical
chemistry has been expected to have a potential for medical and biological
applications ranging from medicines to fundamental studies of molecular
biology. Based on her fabulous work on nanolithographic methods, she got
several awards including Career Development Chair Award, Wayne State
University (2000-2001), Outstanding Scholarly Achievement Award, Wayne State
University (2000), NSF CAREER Award (1997-2001), Arnold and Mabel Beckman
Young Investigator Award (1996-1998), and Camille and Henry Dreyfus New
Faculty Award (1994-1999).
