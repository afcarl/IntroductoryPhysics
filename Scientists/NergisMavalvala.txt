There, she received a bachelor’s degree in astronomy and physics. ("Nergis Mavalvala", 2017). Her area of research is studying gravitational waves; she is well known for being among a team of scientists who detected gravitational waves for the first time. The team detected gravitational waves using the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO). ("Faculty", "Nergis Mavalvala") "The gravitational waves that LIGO detected are ripples in the space-time fabric caused by the motion of compact, massive astrophysical objects such as black holes and neutron stars."
