      <td>Emmy Noether</td>
      <td>Amalie Emmy Noether was a German mathematician and physicist known for her landmark contributions to abstract algebra and theoretical physics. One of her most remarkable discoveries in physics was Noether's theorem. The theorem states that every differentiable symmetry of the action of a physical system has a corresponding conservation law. In 1915, Noether was helping two other scientists, David Hilbert and Felix Klein, to understand Albert Einstein's general relativity theory when she proved Noether's first theorem. Upon receiving her work, Einstein wrote to Hilbert: "Yesterday I received from Miss Noether a very interesting paper... I'm impressed that such things can be understood in such a general way. The old guard at GÃ¶ttingen should take some lessons from Miss Noether! She seems to know her stuff." Noether's theorem has become a fundamental tool of modern theoretical physics because of the insight it gives into conservation laws and also being practical calculation tool. For example, suppose that a new physical phenomenon is discovered. Noether's theorem provides a test for theoretical models of the phenomenon: if the theory has a continuous symmetry, then Noether's theorem guarantees that the theory has a conserved quantity, and for the theory to be correct, this conservation must be observable in experiments.</td>

      <td>Ruby Payne-Scott was an Australian born physicist and radio astronomer. She began work as a physicist with the cancer treatment center at the University of Sydney where she focused on radiation therapy as a form of cancer treatment. She later completed her master's thesis on wavelength distributions of radiation. Ruby worked briefly as a teacher before receiving a job in the radiophysics division of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization where she worked on radar technology for the army. Her most notable contribution, however, lay in her interest in extraterrestrial radio signals. She demonstrated, with the help of two colleagues, that radio brightness across the sky could be treated as a two-dimensional sum of an infinite series of simple waveforms and showed that it could be computed using the Fourier transform. Ruby's work served as a mathematical foundation for radio astronomy. In addition to being a brilliant scientist, she was an avid supporter of women's rights believing in equal employment and pay for women.</td>

Among his many notable accomplishments, which include using differentials centuries before Newton âinventedâ calculus (BhÄskara II), BhÄskara II was one of the first to design a perpetual motion machine. The âBhÄskara wheelâ has curved spokes filled with mercury, which flows downward in the direction of rotation, theoretically creating a shifting force to power perpetual rotation (Simanek 2010). Unfortunately, BhÄskara II didnât account for the unbalancing effect of the mercury flow, which shifts the wheelâs center of mass and eventually disrupts rotation (Simanek). BhÄskara IIâs design has remained a fascination for physicists and countless researchers have tried to optimize his design and create a truly perpetually rotating wheel.  All have failed (Simanek). BhÄskara II was instrumental is the development of Indian mathematics, and was honored in 1981 with an eponymous satellite (BhÄskara II).</td>

      <td>The more I learn about the scientific community, the more I learn about the issues of sexism and racism affecting women and minorities wanting to do research. There is definitely a stigma against women and women of color wanting to do research at a professional level. Countless are the cases, of female scientists that have to choose between having a family and their professional careers, and smaller is the number of women of color that have a leadership position in the labs where they do research. For this reason, it is important to shed the light on inspiring women who are making major contributions to their fields because they are role models that future scientists can look up to. I found a scientist who is making groundbreaking discoveries in the field of lasers. Her name is Hadiyah Green and she is developing laser technologies to kill cancer cells. She earned her PhD in Physics from the University of Alabama Birmingham. After her closest relatives were diagnosed with cancer, she decided to use her background to develop lasers that selectively target cancer cells through the use of nanoparticles. She has tested her treatment on mice and has obtained promising results. In the future, she hopes to advance her research to make it useful for humans.</td>

      <td>Arthur Bertram Cuthbert Walker Jr. (1936-2001) was a solar physicist and a pioneer of EUV/XUV. He was born in Cleveland, Ohio. Dr. Walker Jr. completed his undergraduate studies at Case Institute of technology in Cleveland in 1957 and earned his bachelorâs degree in physics. He completed both his masterâs and doctorate degrees in astrophysics in the University of Illinois, in 1958 and 1962 respectively. He is most noted for having developed the solar corona. Two of his sounding rocket payloads, the Stanford/MSFC Rocket Spectroheliograph Experiment and the Multi-Spectral Solar Telescope Array, recorded the first full-disk, high-resolution images of the Sun in XUV with conventional geometries of normal incidence optics; this technology is now used in solar telescopes such as SOHO/EIT and TRACE, and in the fabrication of microchips via ultraviolet photolithography. Dr. Walker's scientific research focused on radiation from the Sun called extreme ultraviolet light and soft X-rays, which affect the chemistry of Earth's upper atmosphere, including the ozone layer. In the late 1970's, Dr. Walker became interested in what was then considered a risky and untested concept, called multilayer technology, for making special telescope mirrors that could reflect that radiation. He was a professor at Stanford University from 1974 until his death in 2001 and was a member of the Stanfordâs Center for Space and Astrophysics at the school. In addition to his impressive contributions to the field, Dr. Walker Jr. spent a lifetime helping women and minority students find careers in science. He is credited with helping Stanford produce more black physicists with Ph.D.âs than any other university in the nation.</td>

Dr.Jackson studied hadrons as a research associate at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in Batavia, Illinois. She was also a visiting scientist at CERN in Switzerland where she worked on theories relating to elementary particles. She was a part of the Theoretical Physics Research Department at AT&T Bell Laboratories in 1976 and studied materials used in the semiconductor industry. She also researched on the optical and electronic properties of two-dimensional and quasi-two dimensional systems. She made contributions to the knowledge of charged density waves in layered compounds and optical and electronic properties of semiconductor strained-layer superlattices. Since her postgraduate studies, she has been active in initiatives to increase African American participation in science and math. She has been serving as the president of Rensselear Polytechnic Institute since July 1, 1999. She was the first black woman to earn a PhD from MIT. She was the first black woman to be elected to the National Academy of Engineering. She did most of her research on optical and electronic properties of layered materials, surface electrons of liquid helium films, strained-layer semiconductor superlattices, and most notably, the polaronic aspects of electrons in two- dimensional systems.</td>

He developed methods of quantitative x-ray diffractions of compounds; e.g., Ca(OH)2 in hydrous silicates. Robert Bragg originated the now-standard practice of using the data as self-calibrating in the quantitative determination of preferred orientation in polycrystalline aggregates. His work provides clear guidance in the analysis of the diffraction patterns of materials of high transparency to x-rays, e.g. Be, B, and C. His novel studies of the coarsening of the microstructure of glassy carbon using small angle x-ray scattering have provided the accepted value for the activation energy for a-direction vacancy migration in graphite.His most important work is the recent demonstration that all apparently unordered carbon materials are mixtures of metastable carbon compounds, and his first principles derivation of the equations governing the phase transformations at high temperatures as these materials are converted to graphite.</td>

From 1937 to 1939, he was in Germany to study nuclear physics and the quantum field theory. In 1940, he developed the intermediate coupling theory in order to clarify the structure of the meson cloud around the nucleon. During WWII, he solved the motion of electrons in the magnetron and also developed a unified theory of systems consisting of wave guides and cavity resonators. Dr. Tomonaga was the President of the Tokyo University of Education from 1956 to 1962. He has actively campaigned against the spread of nuclear weapons and for peaceful use of nuclear energy.</td>

      <td>Warren Henry was an African American Physicist that had somewhat of an astute background for a black man of his time. Both of his parents had graduated from the Tuskegee Institute, and George Washington Carver lived and conducted research on his parentâs farm during the summer months (Williams). It can be quite apparent to see where his interest in the sciences more than likely came from during his childhood. He later attended Tuskegee where he majored in Mathematics, English, and French (Williams). Later wanting to conduct research, he turned to Rutgers University where they then turned him away (Williams).  As a result, he ended up going to the Naval Research Laboratory where he would reside for the next 12 years (Williams). During that time he was able to research and gain the knowledge of materials that were at a rather low temperature (Williams). His expertise regarding low-temperature research was probably unsurpassed in the U.S. while at the Naval Research Laboratory. He was also the head of several projects at several institutions like UC Berkeley amongst others. Even though his research in low temperatures was quite significant, he was most known for his work in magnetism and superconductivity. His work in this field was what brought him the most praise by the scientific community. He had written a highly detailed study that consisted of a "demonstration of the proof of non-interacting paramagnetic ions and how theyâre a significant contributionâ when considering magnetism and superconductivity (Williams). His work was a significant contribution to the world because his models and ideas have been implemented into modern textbooks, and are still widely used to this day. A prime example of that being the demonstration I had spoken of earlier that took place back in 1934. In relation to where Henryâs work can be found in the textbook, I would imagine that his material could be found in chapter 32 and 33 where it talks about the magnetic field of a current and electromagnetic induction.</td>

      <td>Chien-Shiung Wu (1912-1997) was a Chinese-American experimental physicist who made significant contributions in the field of nuclear physics1 (Wikipedia). Wu worked on the infamous Manhattan Project where she developed the process of separating uranium metal to uranium-235 and uranium-238 by gaseous diffusion1 (Wikipedia). Her work was credited to contradict the hypothetical Law of Conservation of Parity, which at the time was a well-established law and basically entailed a very complicated way of proving the idea of symmetry, where particles that are mirror images of each other will act in identical ways3 (ListVerse). Her experiments were incredibly significant in that she was able to show that one particle was more likely to eject an electron than the other and they were therefore not symmetrical and that observation overturned a 30-year belief and shattered the conservation of parity law3 (ListVerse). The discovery of parity violation was a major contribution to particle physics and the development of the Standard Model which is a paradigm of the modern quantum field theory2 (Wikipedia). It is little wonder that Wu is now hailed as âThe First Lady of Physicsâ and the âChinese Marie Curieâ1(Wikipedia). However, unfortunately, like many of her contemporary female scientists, Wuâs work was discredited and her male co-workers Lee and Yang got awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics for âherâ experiment3 (ListVerse). In fact, she received no mention or credit for her significant contribution to the project until 1978, when she was awarded the inaugural Wolf Prize for Physics two decades after her ground-breaking experiment1(Wikipedia).</td>
